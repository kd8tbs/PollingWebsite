      <h2>Short Project Description</h2>
      <p>Pollinate is a rating system; not just any rating system, but it is non-biased and is meant to see how the public feels about items, ideas, platforms, etc. It also is a way to share personal ratings among peers, a way for businesses and their owners to see if the critics are feeling different than the general populous as well as to monitor how rivals are doing compared to themselves.  </p>
      Users will have to create a profile to access Pollinate. After creating a profile, the user will be able to make polls, participate in public polls, as well as create personal links for polls for their friends/other users to access in private. Users will see that the polls will have percentages based on Pollinates users voting for items in a category. When making polls, users have the option of choosing what their poll will be categorized as, such as: sports, general appliances, etc. They also choose the title of their poll, add answers, and decide if it will be public or private. <br><br>
      Pollinate will use a JavaScript-based library called React for the user interface. It will be accessible to home devices such as desktops and laptops, but its accessibility can also extend to smart phones and tablets. Going to the store and choosing a brand based on other Pollinate userâ€™s responses that are open to the public. Alternatively, users can discuss with their friends who the MVP of a sport is, send a link and rate the top athletes in a private manner.</p>
