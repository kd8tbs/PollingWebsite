write a website that allows users to creat a poll and send it via a link for people to vote on in react

Creating a full website to allow users to create polls and send them via a link for people to vote on requires multiple components, such as a front-end built with React, a back-end for handling data storage, and a database to store the information.

Below is a high-level overview of the project structure and some essential components to get started:

Project Structure
lua
Copy code
my-poll-app/
|-- backend/
|   |-- server.js
|   |-- routes/
|   |   |-- pollRoutes.js
|   |-- models/
|   |   |-- Poll.js
|-- frontend/
|   |-- public/
|   |-- src/
|   |   |-- components/
|   |   |   |-- CreatePoll.js
|   |   |   |-- Poll.js
|   |   |   |-- Vote.js
|   |   |   |-- Result.js
|   |   |-- App.js
|   |   |-- index.js
|-- package.json
|-- .env
Set up your environment
Use create-react-app to create a new React application.
Use Express for the backend server.
Use MongoDB (with Mongoose) as the database for storing poll data.
Install necessary dependencies: axios, cors, and dotenv.
Create the database schema
In the models/Poll.js file, define a Mongoose schema for the polls:

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const pollSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  question: { type: String, required: true },
  options: [
    {
      option: { type: String, required: true },
      votes: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    },
  ],
  created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Poll', pollSchema);
Set up the Express server and API routes
In the backend/server.js and backend/routes/pollRoutes.js files, create the Express server and define the API routes for creating a poll, voting, and fetching results.

Create the React components
Create the following components in the frontend/src/components/ folder:

CreatePoll.js: Component to allow users to create polls.
Poll.js: Component to display the poll question and options for voting.
Vote.js: Component to handle user's vote submission.
Result.js: Component to display the poll results.
Connect the React app to the backend server
Use Axios to make HTTP requests from the React components to interact with the backend server.

Deploy your application
Deploy your React frontend and Express backend to your preferred hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Heroku, Vercel).

Remember that the code provided is a high-level overview. You will need to fill in the details and implement the actual functionality. This should give you a good starting point for building your poll application in React.

how would I do it using expressjs as the backend
To create a poll website using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, follow the steps below:

Set up your environment
Use create-react-app to create a new React application.
Create a new folder named backend inside the project directory.
In the backend folder, run npm init to create a package.json file.
Install necessary dependencies: express, cors, mongoose, axios, dotenv, and body-parser.
Create a .env file in the backend folder to store your MongoDB connection string.
Create the database schema
Create a folder named models inside the backend folder.
In the models folder, create a file named Poll.js and define the Mongoose schema for the polls, as described in the previous answer.
Set up the Express server and API routes
In the backend folder, create a file named server.js.
In server.js, set up an Express server with cors and body-parser middleware.
Connect to the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.
Create a folder named routes inside the backend folder.
In the routes folder, create a file named pollRoutes.js.
In pollRoutes.js, define the API routes for creating a poll, voting, and fetching results.
Example server.js:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const pollRoutes = require('./routes/pollRoutes');
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use('/api/polls', pollRoutes);

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
Example pollRoutes.js:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Poll = require('../models/Poll');

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  // Create a new poll and save it to the database
});

router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve a poll by ID
});

router.put('/:id/vote', async (req, res) => {
  // Update the votes count for a specific option in a poll
});

module.exports = router;
Create the React components
Follow the steps described in the previous answer to create the React components: CreatePoll.js, Poll.js, Vote.js, and Result.js.
Connect the React app to the backend server
Use Axios to make HTTP requests from the React components to interact with the backend server.
Run both frontend and backend
In your backend folder, run node server.js or use nodemon for auto-reloading during development.
In your React app, run npm start to launch the development server.
Deploy your application
Deploy your React frontend and Express backend to your preferred hosting service (e.g., Netlify for the frontend, Heroku for the backend).
Remember that the code provided is a high-level overview. You will need to fill in the details and implement the actual functionality. This should give you a good starting point for building your poll application in React with Express.js as the backend.
